My name (王智豪) means "proud of wisdom" in Chinese.

I am an undergraduate student pursuing dual degrees in Economics and Psychology at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn). My research interests lie in moral judgment and economic decision-making. Currently, my projects focus on the occurrence of prosocial and irrational behaviors, as well as group-based moral judgments. I employ a variety of methods to explore the questions of interest, including behavioral experiments, social surveys, and cognitive modeling. 

Outside of school, I like tennis and billiards. I like to read books on political philosophy and ethics, and the ancients always make me feel the shock of human thought.

Professor [Lusha Zhu](https://www.lushazhu.com) and assistant professor [Phyliss Gai Jia](http://www.phylissgai.com) directed my research.
